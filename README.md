# Concept Travel Application

A Travel app project created in flutter using BloC, Cubit and equatable. Travel app supports both web and mobile.

## Getting Started
The Travel app contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project.
The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme,
constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using Travel app code as standard initializer,
we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by
allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
